temporary file to list todos to keep oversight

desktop UI:
- restore desktop UI

mobile UI:
- initial favourites icon in operations should be hidden until the dropdown is opened
- bootstrap native 'x' in input[type="search"] should clear input value and
  then display categories rather than close the entire dropdown
- test with keyboard popping up because that messes with the viewheights on mobile probably
- make sure panels in workspace-wrapper grow and add up to 100%

general ui:
- fix up key events so UI can be navigated comfortably with keys ( inc. visual focus feedback )

js:
- core/Recipe.mjs:
- core/lib/Magic.js:
  // @TODO: return import to original? ( it breaks dev though )
- waiters/OperationsWaiter.mjs:
  // @TODO: isVisible is pretty generic so probably move it ( to manager? )
- App.mjs:
  // @TODO: in setup, add a window resize listener for responsive functions

misc:
- write / complete UI tests
- delete this file when done :)
