operations:
- UI tests etc.

manual testing issues

mobile:
- all ops with bootstrap checkboxes in recipe break ( due to the bootstrap checkbox func not being applied ). Need to replace / remove this
- on ingredient input change ( for instance 'to charcode' 'base' or whatever ) on backspace / removing the value, there is a popup at teh bottem [object Object]. Also happens on actual CC but still. Only happens when value = null
