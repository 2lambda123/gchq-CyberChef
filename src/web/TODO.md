operations:
- UI tests etc.

manual testing issues

mobile:
- drag any recipe li will have an ( clone? ) extra li below it with 'undefined' title. Not on desktop
- hitboxes combined with drag / mouse events on breakpoint and disable icons kind of sucks
- some issues tapping on ingredients causing the op-dropdown to display
- some issues with ingredient breakpoint / disable background colors
