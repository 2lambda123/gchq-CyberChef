# TODOS 181
## Temporary file to list todos for keeping oversight for issue [181]

---

#### Mobile UI ( on real device ):
- need long press checks on mobile to add favourites ( recipe is done ) >
        - check on window resizing

- shannon entropy thingies

- backspace on fs view should close max view. Keep making the same mistake and navigating away when for instance recipe is expanded and double click the window to fs > resolve. Reset layout


### Desktop UI:
### General UI:
- fix up key / tab events so UI can be navigated comfortably with keys ( inc. visual focus feedback ). Probably a lot of
work though

### JS:
- `core/Recipe.mjs`, `core/lib/Magic.js` return imports to original

### Misc:
- Gruntfile revert dev config
- check for lingering @TODO across code
- comb through CSS and improve organisation for better DevX. Ask repo owners to open another issue perhaps and just
redo all of the stylesheets ( preferably with SASS )
- delete this file when done :)
