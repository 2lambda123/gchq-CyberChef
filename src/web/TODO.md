# TODOS 181
## Temporary file to list todos for keeping oversight for issue [181]

---

#### Mobile UI ( on real device ):
- shannon entropy thingies
- maybe a bit annoying that the fav cat opens whenever you add a new fav via icon-fav-click on mobile
- backspace on fs view should close max view. Keep making the same mistake and navigating away when for instance recipe is expanded and double click the window to fs > resolve. Reset layout

### Desktop
- fixed status panel ( rhs ) overlays recipe column if split all the way to the right

### JS:
- `core/Recipe.mjs`, `core/lib/Magic.js` return imports to original

### Misc:
- Gruntfile revert dev config
- Update README instructions per Mobile UI
- delete this file when done :)
