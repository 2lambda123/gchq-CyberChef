# TODOS 181
## Temporary file to list todos for keeping oversight for issue [181]

---

#### Mobile UI ( on real device ):
- How to add operations to favourites since drag and drop is now disabled on mobile ( maybe a star icon...? )
- Recipe list on mobile panel is too small to comfortably scroll and change order of recipes

- test *thoroughly* with keyboard popping up because that messes with view-heights on mobile probably and might make it a very frustrating experience
- test drag and drop etc. Regular mobile events / UX
- view-heights not correct due to variable taskbar on mobile devices

### Desktop UI:
### General UI:
- fix up key / tab events so UI can be navigated comfortably with keys ( inc. visual focus feedback ). Probably a lot of work though

### JS:
- `core/Recipe.mjs`, `core/lib/Magic.js` return imports to original

### Misc:
- Gruntfile revert dev config
- check for lingering @TODO across code
- comb through CSS and improve organisation for better DevX. Ask repo owners to open another issue perhaps and just redo all of the stylesheets ( preferably with SASS )
- delete this file when done :)
