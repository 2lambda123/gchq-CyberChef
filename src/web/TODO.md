recipe:
- ignore dropped item outside of rec-list
- bit smoother sort experience would be nice

operations:
- can only drag an op to favourites 1 time
- popovers should also show on key up and down per operation
- after dragging op to rec, popover no longer works on original op ( see opSortEnd )

- stupid popovers on deleting favs for instance ( dont always close nicely )
- UI tests etc.

--------

x highlight strings
x esc on focused-op search results will add that op to recipe
x be able to tab from panel to panel, open and close them, use up and down arrows
x little line on click ( for all input fields, also ingredient focus )
x native focus thingy is a bit ugly
x RecipeWaiter opSortEnd()

wont do
x initial search is kinda slow
